| Heritage | **23 published stories** (+ Heritage #19 Red Snapper Fleet scaffolded, research in progress) |
| Dispatch | **1 published** — "Port Aransas — A Tale of Two Islands" (features/analysis/reporting). Tip form at /dispatch (Resend-powered; replaces old mailto) |
| SEO schema | **Complete layer stack (2026-04-23):** WebSite, Organization, LocalBusiness, Article, NewsArticle (pre-existing) + FAQPage on /essentials + BreadcrumbList on all 4 detail route types + ItemList on /guides/[slug] + Place/TouristAttraction/LandmarksOrHistoricalBuildings on 6 Heritage landmark pieces |
| GSC indexing | 13/192 indexed (young-site crawl budget; 0 quality exclusions, 0 404s — clean health). 9 priority URLs submitted for indexing 2026-04-23. |

| A2P 10DLC | Brand APPROVED; **campaign resubmitted 2026-04-22** after TCR failure on bundled consent — new submission has separate-opt-in architecture, IN_PROGRESS at TCR |
| Email automation | Spec drafted (`Port A Local/Email Automation.md`); Layer 1 (Gmail UI filters/responders/templates) ready for Winston to configure (~20 min); Layer 2 (server-side inbound parsing) tied to cart marketplace buildout |
